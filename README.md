👋 Hi, I’m Moses — an intermediate Python programmer with a passion for data analysis, machine learning, and embedded systems.

🖥️ Currently analysing KUCCPS cluster points and courses. Planning to make a machine learning model that will predict the next cluster points judging from the trend.

⚙️ Enthusiastic about data visualization, web scraping, and backend.

🗂️ Frequently diving into pandas, SQL, and web technologies to expand my skillset. I'm invested in pandas for data analysis and looking to dive into other libraries too.

📝 Practicing clean, well-structured, and efficient code.
